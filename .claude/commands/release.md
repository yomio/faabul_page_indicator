description: Bump package version, update changelog, verify metadata, and create a GitHub release
---

## Preparation

- Ensure you're on the main branch and it's up to date
- Check for any uncommitted changes and refuse to continue if found
- Run all tests to ensure everything is working
- Analyze code to ensure no issues

## Version Bump

- Determine the version bump type from $ARGUMENTS (patch, minor, major) or ask the user if not provided
- Read current version from pubspec.yaml
- Calculate new version based on semantic versioning rules
- Update version in pubspec.yaml

## Changelog Update

- Ask the user for a changelog entry or generate one based on recent commits since last release
- Update CHANGELOG.md with the new version and changes
- Ensure proper formatting following the existing pattern

## Metadata Verification and Updates

- Verify pubspec.yaml metadata:
  - description is accurate
  - homepage, repository, and issue_tracker URLs are correct
  - topics are relevant
  - environment constraints are appropriate
  - dependencies are up to date
  
- Verify and update README.md:
  - Check if version badge needs updating (if present)
  - Ensure installation instructions reference the new version
  - Verify all links are working
  - Update any version-specific documentation

- Verify LICENSE file exists and is valid

- Check example/pubspec.yaml if it exists and update dependency version

## Pre-release Checks

- Run `flutter pub publish --dry-run` to verify package is ready
- Run `flutter analyze` to ensure no issues
- Run `flutter test` to ensure all tests pass
- Generate a summary of all changes

## User Confirmation

- Present a summary of:
  - Current version â†’ New version
  - Changelog entry
  - Files that will be modified
  - Any metadata updates made
- PROMPT THE USER TO CONFIRM before proceeding

## Commit and Tag

- Stage all modified files
- Commit with message: "Release v{version}"
- Create an annotated git tag: "v{version}"
- Push commit and tag to origin

## GitHub Release

- Create a GitHub release using `gh release create`:
  - Use the new version tag
  - Set release title as "v{version}"
  - Use the changelog entry as release notes
  - Attach any relevant assets if needed

## Publish to pub.dev

- Ask the user if they want to publish to pub.dev
- If yes, run `flutter pub publish`
- Provide the pub.dev package URL for verification

## Post-release

- Confirm the release was created successfully on GitHub
- Provide links to:
  - GitHub release page
  - pub.dev package page (if published)
- Suggest creating a new branch for next development cycle if needed
